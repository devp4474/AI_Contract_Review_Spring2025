Management and dispersal of Tropilaelaps honey bee mites experiencing a
continental climate.
Problem and Significance
This work addresses PAms mission to improve honey bee health by examining management
and biology of a honey bee pest which could severely impact U.S. beekeepers. The research will
address knowledge gaps concerning the management and dispersal of the mite Tropilaelaps
mercedesae in Apis mellifera honey bee colonies. This information will contribute to the
development of appropriate plans if Tropilaelaps is introduced to the U.S., and will identify
effective Tropilaelaps management strategies should it become established. To accomplish this,
we will perform two field experiments in South Korea, and communicate our findings to
appropriate government agencies and the beekeeping community.

2. Date and Duration of Proposed Study
Submission date: 1 June 2023
Duration of study: 1 January 2024  1 July 2025
3. Problem and Significance
The Tropilaelaps mercedesae mite has the potential to harm the U.S. beekeeping industry
like the Varroa destructor mite has done since it was introduced to the U.S. in the 1980s. Reports
from Asia, where the mite is currently present, suggest that Tropilaelaps parasitism causes
greater colony losses than Varroa (Buawangpong et al. 2015; Ritter & Schneider-Ritter 1988).
Feeding by Tropilaelaps on developing Apis mellifera honey bee larvae and pupae results in
disease transmission, reduced honey bee weight upon adult emergence, and shortened adult
honey bee life span (Khongphinitbunjong et al. 2015; 2016).
To protect U.S. honey bees, it is critical to prepare for a potential future introduction of
Tropilaelaps to the U.S. We currently lack knowledge on the mites routes of dispersal between
colonies, and we lack documented tools that can eradicate the mite without destroying colonies;
these are two priorities identified by USDA-APHIS as critical to developing an appropriate

response plan. Knowledge of these areas of biology and management will be essential in an
eradication program, but will also be useful for continued management if the mite becomes
established in the U.S. Therefore, the proposed work fulfills PAms overall mission of improving
honey bee health by investigating practical, non-destructive control solutions for Tropilaelaps
mites and by examining routes of Tropilaelaps dispersal.
Similar to that of Varroa, the life cycle of Tropilaelaps has two phases  reproductive and
dispersal (Traynor et al. 2020; Woyke 1994). During the reproductive phase, they reproduce
within capped brood cells and feed on developing larvae and pupae; during the dispersal phase,
they reside on adult bees. The Tropilaelaps mite spends only one-half to one-third as much time
in the dispersal phase as Varroa (Häubermann et al. 2016; Woyke 1994). This not only increases
the reproductive rate of Tropilaelaps compared to Varroa, but also limits effective chemical
control since most of the mites are protected by the wax capping of a brood cell (Buawangpong
et al. 2015; Woyke 1987). Unlike Varroa, there is no evidence that Tropilaelaps feeds on adult
honey bees during its dispersal phase (Rinderer et al. 1994).
To completely eliminate Tropilaelaps without destroying colonies, we propose to deprive the
mites of brood (eliminating their protected location and food source), and to apply chemical
treatment when all mites are in the dispersal phase on adult bees. By caging the queen for 24
days, we will induce the absence of brood (brood break), which has not been examined for
Tropilaelaps control since the early 1990s in western Asia (Woyke 1985; Woyke 1994).
Treatment with formic acid alone (a U.S.-registered treatment for honey bees) provided ~90%
efficacy against Tropilaelaps (Pettis et al. 2017) but was not sufficient to eliminate them
completely. By combining a brood break with chemical treatment with formic acid or oxalic
acid, we hope to achieve 100% efficacy against Tropilaelaps.
Also critical to developing a response to Tropilaelaps is an understanding of the ability of the
mite to disperse between colonies and apiaries  to assess the risk and speed of spread from a
location of first introduction. It is speculated that Tropilaelaps mites primarily disperse among
colonies via exchange of brood frames during colony equalization, splitting, and consolidation
(K. Khongphinitbunjong, personal communication); however, drifting adult honey bees or
robbing forager honey bees may also play a role (Rath et al. 1991; Laigo & Morse 1968). During
the dispersal phase, Varroa mites in colonies with low infestation rates prefer to feed on nurse
bees; however, that preference disappears with mites in highly infested colonies as they attach to
older workers that leave the colony, enabling dispersal to other colonies (Cervo et al. 2014). To
date, no studies have evaluated natural routes of Tropilaelaps mite dispersal. This is important to
evaluating the feasibility of containment, especially because feral colonies would likely be
present near infested colonies.
4. Objectives
1) To determine whether the combination of a brood break and chemical treatment eliminates or
reduces Tropilaelaps mite infestation in Apis mellifera honey bee colonies.
2) To describe natural dispersal routes of Tropilaelaps mites from Apis mellifera honey bee
colonies.

5. Experimental Design and Methods
Objective 1: To determine whether the combination of a brood break and chemical treatment
eliminates or reduces Tropilaelaps mite infestation in Apis mellifera honey bee colonies.
In South Korea during late summer 2024, four treatments groups each with 10 queenright
Apis mellifera honey bee colonies will be rented from a local beekeeper. Initially, we will
measure the population of brood and adult honey bees (Delaplane et al. 2013), and uncap 200
brood cells to determine the Tropilaelaps infestation rate (Dietemann et al. 2013; Pettis et al.
2017). We will also assess the infestation rate of adult honey bees using the alcohol wash method
(Anderson & Roberts 2013). Colonies will be assigned to treatments, ensuring that colony
strength and Tropilaelaps infestation are similar among groups. Treatment groups will include:
1) negative control, no management action, 2) brood break only, 3) brood break + oxalic acid
dribble, and 4) brood break + FormicPro®. These treatment groups were chosen because a brood
break only management plan was shown to be effective in previous studies (Woyke 1985; 1994).
Oxalic acid should also be effective when no brood are present, and formic acid was recently
shown to be effective against Tropilaelaps mites in the presence of brood (Pettis et al. 2017). On
experiment day 0, colonies receiving the brood break will have their queen caged in a QCC
queen cage (Thorne Beekeeping) attached to the top of a centrally placed brood frame (Büchler
et al. 2020). Colonies will again be assessed on day 24 for brood and adult honey bee population
size, as well as adult honey bee Tropilaelaps infestation rate (Anderson & Roberts 2013;
Delaplane et al. 2013). At this time, queens will be released because all mites will be in their
dispersal phase on adult honey bees due to the brood break. In FormicPro® colonies, one strip
will be applied on day 24, followed by a second strip on day 34. During the brood break, oxalic
acid treatment colonies will receive treatment using the dribble/solution method according to the
U.S. label rate. We suspect these treatments will be adequate because no mites will be protected
in brood cells. Once the queen has been laying and brood are present, 200 cells per colony will
again be uncapped on day 60 to measure infestation rate in brood cells, as well as adult honey
bee infestation rate, and brood and adult bee population (Dietemann et al. 2013; Pettis et al.
2017; Anderson & Roberts 2013 Delaplane et al. 2013).
Pitfalls: A potential challenge to the proposed work is finding colonies with sufficient
Tropilaelaps infestation rates. However, the South Korean collaborator has excellent connections
with local beekeepers so we anticipate that appropriate colonies will be identified; they will work
with beekeepers several months in advance of the trial to ensure success. Furthermore, the trial
will be performed in late summer when mite populations are historically high. Lastly, is potential
that our queens do not resume laying after 24 days of caging. This should be alleviated by our
use of the large queen cage (33x12x80 mm), which is designed for extended caging events
(Büchler et al. 2020). Nonetheless, we will have mated queens available in case of issues with
queen re-establishment.
Objective 2: To describe natural dispersal routes of Tropilaelaps mites from Apis mellifera honey
bee colonies.
At least 15 Apis mellifera honey bee colonies will be inspected by uncapping 200 brood
cells to evaluate Tropilaelaps infestation rates (Dietemann et al. 2013; Pettis et al. 2017), and
then assigned to three treatment groups: 1) normal-functioning colonies with a brood infestation
rate of 1-5%, 2) normal-functioning colonies with a brood infestation rate of >10%, and 3)
normal-functioning colonies with a brood infestation rate of >10% to be experimentally

weakened to encourage robbing. Treatment groups were chosen based on Varroa mites
preference for nurse bees in colonies with a low mite infestation rate, which disappears with
increasing infestation (Cervo et al. 2014). If Tropilaelaps dispersal is like that of Varroa, colonies
with higher infestation rates will be more likely to have Tropilaelaps on exiting adults, and the
weakened colonies would be most likely to have dispersal mites on exiting adults (including
robber honey bees). Each colony will be fitted with a funnel trap designed to collect exiting adult
honey bees (Medrzycki 2013). Traps will be engaged for 10-15 minutes once a week for two
months so that adult worker and drone honey bees can be collected. We will assess the
infestation rate of these trapped bees using the alcohol wash method (Anderson & Roberts 2013).
Pitfalls: The major potential pitfall is improper functioning of the funnel trap. To avoid this,
we are currently testing prototypes in Auburn after discussing with the researcher who originally
designed the trap. As with Objective 1, low colony Tropilaelaps infestation rates could limit this
work, but again we think this will be overcome with the connections of the South Korean
collaborator to identify suitable colonies; additionally, colonies from his existing research apiary
can be used.
6. Intended Outcome
The intended outcome of this work is twofold: first, to support the development of
appropriate Tropilaelaps response guidelines by USDA-APHIS, and second, to inform U.S.
beekeepers of effective Tropilaelaps management strategies. Knowledge concerning non-
destructive honey bee colony actions, as well as natural dispersal of the mite, are critical to the
development of an appropriate response plan.
This work will be done in conjunction with similar research scheduled to be conducted in
Thailand. Together, the proposed experiments in South Korea and the planned experiments in
Thailand will prepare for an introduction of Tropilaelaps in cooler or warmer weather,
respectively. By testing formic acid and oxalic acid in both these conditions, we will test
management actions that suit the diverse climatic regions of the U.S. Furthermore, most work on
Tropilaelaps biology and management has been performed in Thailand, but traits affecting
management and dispersal could vary among regional populations of Tropilaelaps. By
replicating the work in South Korea, we importantly would determine whether the Tropilaelaps
dispersal behavior is consistent between these two potential source populations of Tropilaelaps
mites.
Dissemination of findings: Results from these experiments will be reported to USDA-APHIS to
address their current knowledge gaps, and will be communicated through talks at national
entomology and beekeeper meetings (e.g. Entomological Society of America, American
Beekeeping Federation, American Honey Producers Association) and in scientific journals.
7. Economic Feasibility for New Products
We do not anticipate that any new products will be developed from this research. However,
we anticipate identifying new uses for miticides (Formic Pro® and oxalic acid) and procedures
(brood breaks) that are currently registered and employed in the U.S. If effective, both miticides
could immediately be used by beekeepers against Tropilaelaps, should it be detected in the U.S.,

because products can be applied to a new target pest if they are applied according to label rates
(FIFRA 2012).
8. Project Timeline
The proposed project timeline is for funding over 18 months to allow for all experiments to
be conducted, data to be analyzed, and results be written and submitted to a scientific journal for
publication (Table 1). Research will be conducted in 2024 with funds provided through June
2025 to account for the open access publishing fee and communication of results to beekeepers.

9. Information Regarding Prior or Simultaneous Submissions
A proposal has been submitted to USDA-APHIS to conduct a similar study in Thailand
during Spring 2024. The purpose of performing similar work in different geographic regions of
Asia is to ensure that Tropilaelaps and Apis mellifera populations from Thailand are not over-
represented when building an understanding of this important parasite. It is possible that slight
differences in genotype-environment interactions could misinform response guidelines and the
U.S. beekeeping community (Büchler et al. 2014). The purpose of performing work in different
climatic regions and at different periods of the year is to improve our understanding of how two
active ingredients commonly used in the U.S. against Varroa  formic acid and oxalic acid  will
perform against Tropilaelaps under conditions likely to be experienced by U.S. beekeepers. It is
well-documented that the effectiveness of formic acid against Varroa is affected by ambient
temperature (Steube et al. 2021); this is likely also the case for Tropilaelaps.

This proposal does not include a request for matching funds.
